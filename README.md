# Gabby Farrell Project Contribution
This [branch](https://github.com/Year4-Games-Development/Team1-Game2/tree/gabby) was made on the weekend before the deadline, after speaking with you (Matt) in the lab about separating my code contribution.  

My code could not be utilized when every member's features were combined due to many bugs, confusion and miscommunication. On this branch, my code is demonstrated in the console using a character representaion of the model, so that my features could be graded independently to the other features.
